# VbProjectCodeToRootOfChosenDirectory tool
- Write all found .bas and .frm files from vbSourceDirectory recursively to the root of
a destination folder. 
### Then you can use Find All References in Birokrat by opening it in VS code!

## Usage

Open the .sln file and set the static vars **VbSourceDirectory** (Prg in the case of birokrat) and **DestinationDirectory** (any arbitrary file). Make sure that **DestinationDirectory** exists.
